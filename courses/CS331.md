# CS 331: Analysis and Design of Algorithms (2+0+2)
### Prerequisite: CS 212 + MATH 251
Concepts of an algorithm, solvable and unsolvable problems, Time and space requirements of
algorithms involving iteration and recursion, Order notation and complexity classes, Use of
mathematical techniques (such as recurrence relations) as tools for analyzing the complexity
of algorithms. Polynomial, logarithmic, and exponential complexities, Study of algorithms for
various problems including sorting, searching, graphs, branch and bound strategies, dynamic
programming, algebraic methods, string matching and sets.
