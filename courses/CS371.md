# CS 371: Numerical Methods (2+2+0)
### Prerequisites: MATH 102 + MATH 241 + CS 102
Overview of continuous mathematics background necessary for research in robotics, vision,
and graphics: the conjugate gradient method; ordinary and partial differential equations;
Numerical computation for mathematical, computational, and physical sciences, and
engineering. Emphasis is from the perspective of the computer scientist. Use of numerical
algorithms in engineering practice. Problems of accurately computing solutions in the
presence of rounding errors and of computing discrete approximations of solutions which are
defined on the continuum. The taxonomy of problem classes with methods for their solution
and principles useful for analysis of performance and algorithmic development. Topics also
include: error analysis, the solution of linear and nonlinear equations, triangular and band
matrices, interpolation and numerical differentiation, Least squares and curve fitting, and the
approximation of integrals the solution of differential equations.
