# CS 321: Theory of Computation (2+2+0)
### Prerequisite: MATH 251
The basic concepts of the theory of computation are studied. Topics include: models of
computation, polynomial time, Church's thesis; universal algorithms, non-decidability and
intractability; time and space complexity, non-determinism, probabilistic computation and
reductions of computational problems.
